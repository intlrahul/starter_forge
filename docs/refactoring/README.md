## Guidelines for Refactoring Documentation

When adding new refactoring documentation:

1. **File Naming**: Use `UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES_REFACTORING.md` format
2. **Content Structure**: Include:
   - **Overview**: What was refactored and why
   - **Before/After**: Clear comparison of old vs new approach
   - **Implementation Steps**: Detailed steps taken
   - **Benefits**: What was gained from the refactoring
   - **Migration Guide**: How to adopt the new pattern
3. **Code Examples**: Include relevant code snippets showing changes
4. **Testing**: Document how the refactoring was validated
